# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

We were tasked with creating an application that records employee salaries, and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. We solved the problem by creating creating input fields and application structure in html, then using Javascript/jQuery to manage the input values and calculations. Lastly using CSS to style the application.
